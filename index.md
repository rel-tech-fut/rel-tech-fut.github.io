## What is pattern recognition?

In order to navigate their environments, animals make sense of the sensory information available to them by extracting useful patterns from their sensory inputs. The ability to identify patterns in sensory stimuli is called *pattern recognition*. The patterns that an animal identifies will shape its behavior, so pattern recognition ability affects the animalâ€™s chance of survival.

Pattern recognition is currently most evolved in humans, and [some](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141622/) argue that this explains why humans are so advanced in comparison to all other species.

Moreover, pattern recognition is an integral part of all human thought because it heavily influences the way humans perceive and interact with the world.
