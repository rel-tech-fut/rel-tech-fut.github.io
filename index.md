## What is pattern recognition?

Animals only process a fraction of the vast amounts of sensory information available to them. To handle the large amounts of information, animals focus their attention on important elements of sensory input. In order to know what sensory input is important, animals learn to identify useful patterns in their environments as they encounter similar situations over time. This cognitive process of extracting important information from the environment based on past experience is referred to as *pattern recognition*.

Although all animals beings use pattern recognition as a way to understand their environments, pattern recognition is currently most evolved in humans. [Some](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141622/) even argue that this is the main reason why humans are so advanced in comparison to all other species.

Pattern recognition is an integral part of all human thought because it heavily influences the way humans perceive and interact with the world. To illustrate this, we can explore the role pattern recognition plays on the way humans *see*.

### **Example: Sight**
Scientists know that the [occipital lobe](http://www.spinalcord.com/occipital-lobe) is the region of the brain primarily responsible for processing visual information. 

The occipital lobe contains different types of neurons that fire depending on different types of visual stimuli. For example, the orientation columns of the occipital cortex contain neurons that specialize in detecting the angles of lines. These neurons allow animals to outline the boundaries of shapes, which allows animals to perceive the shapes of objects.

In 1982, Roger Tootell conducted an experiment which showed that neurons in these specialized regions of occipital lobe will fire in a way that corresponds to the actual perceived shapes. The images below show the way a section of the occipital lobe resembles the visual stimulus. This shows that the visual patterns we see in the real world are the same patterns our neurons create when they fire. The brain learns to recognize these patterns and makes inferences based on these patterns.

Although scientists do not have a perfectly clear understanding on the way the brain learns to assign meaning to visual objects, they do know that the occipital lobe works in conjunction with the temporal and frontal lobes to do so. The [temporal lobe](http://www.spinalcord.com/temporal-lobe) is important to memory formation, and the [frontal lobe](http://www.spinalcord.com/frontal-lobe) is vital to reasoning and learning. Still, it is clear that learning to recognize visual patterns in our environments is the only way we are able to understand what we see.

### **Optical Illusions** 

These optical illusions stimulate the orientation columns in our occipital lobes becuase they involve lines and angles.
